{"description": "In the big data era traditional data management and analytic systems are no more adequate. Hence, to manage and fruitfully exploit the huge amount of available heterogeneous data, novel data models, programming paradigms, information systems, and network architectures are needed. The course addresses the challenges arising in the Big Data era. Specifically, the course will cover how to collect, store, retrieve, and analyze big data to mine useful knowledge and insightful hints. The course covers not only data model and data analytics aspects but also novel programming paradigms (e.g., MapReduce, Spark RDDs) and discusses how they can be exploit to support big data scientists to extract insights from data.", "prerequisites": "Object-oriented programming skills.\nJava language, and basic knowledge of traditional database concepts (relational model and SQL language).", "topics": "Lectures (45 hours)\n\u0009\u2022 Introduction to Big data: characteristics, problems, opportunities (3 hours)\n\u0009\u2022 Hadoop and its ecosystem: infrastructure and basic components (3 hours)\n\u0009\u2022 Map Reduce programming paradigm (10.5 hours)\n\u0009\u2022 Spark: Spark Architecture and RDD-based programming paradigm (14.5 hours)\n\u0009\u2022 Streaming data analysis: Spark Streaming (6 hours)\n\u0009\u2022 Data mining and Machine learning libraries: Spark MLlib (6 hours)\n\u0009\u2022 Databases for Big data: data models, design, and querying (e.g., HBase) (1.5 hours)\n\nLaboratory activities (15 hours)\n\u0009\u2022 Developing of applications by means of Hadoop and Spark (15 hours)"}
